    - Too Long; Didn't Read
    ## The Macbook 2019 16"
    ### Pros
    - Quality feeling product
    - Touch bar is surprisingly useful
    - Touch pad is big and brilliant
    - Battery is phenomenal
    - Software development environment is perfect - unix > windows
    ### Cons
    - Pricey
    #### The laptop is incredible. But if you don't need a mac specifically for what it offers i.e. you'll be browsing the web and making presentation/spreadsheet/written documents. Save yourself some money and get a Chromebook - trust me, they're much better value for money
    ## The iPhone 11 pro
    ### Pros
    - Security
    - FaceID
    - Shake to Undo
    - One handed mode
    ### Cons
    - Home screen isn't customisable (apps or widgets)
    - Ringing takes whole screen
    - Floating Video not available
    - Split screen/floating apps not available
    - Notifications are awful
    - There isn't an always on display
    #### I feel like I've taken a step backwards in mobile technology from the Google Pixel 2 XL - which had it's own downfalls
    ## The Apple Watch Series 5
    ### Pros
    - Apple pay
    - Fantastic screen
    - Waterproof technology is top quality
    - Loads of applications available and they're optimised for the watch
    ### Cons
    - You need an iPhone
    - Does anyone even need a wearable?
    #### This would be the only reason I considered keeping an iPhone... but I just can't do it to myself. So unfortunately it'll be goodbye to the watch

Rewind around one year ago and I was a member of a team consisting of three developers, partaking in a Hackathon (a 24 hour coding challenge to build a small application). I was using a very powerful Microsoft Surface (laptop) running, of course, windows. The application we created used the camera on the laptop to analyse facial movements to interpret the mood or sentiment of a person; it would then send a notification to my Google Pixel phone, running stock android, which would send an alert to my Samsung Galaxy S3 smart watch. The system ran perfectly, and we won the prize for “Best use of Technology” in the Hackathon. It was a fantastic experience. However, within my team I was the only developer not using a Macbook, and getting my developer environment setup took a substantial amount of the 24 hours available. For the Mac users it was almost instant - it was ridiculous to be honest. Two months later, I made the first purchase of three Apple products I’m now running as a part of an Apple ecosystem: Macbook Pro, iPhone 11 Pro and Apple Watch Series 5.

## The Macbook
The Macbook Pro (2019), 16” was my first Apple product (iPods from the early 2000 don’t count) in my migration. The purchase was met with pure excitement, especially as they slapped on a beautiful 10% discount because I was wearing my old university hoodie - the savings went straight to a post laptop purchase Nandos.
### It’s beautiful
Moving from Windows to MacOS was not an initial big deal. Things work as you’d expect, you press the Chrome icon and Chrome opens, not really mind blowing. However, the quality of the laptop and the small details Apple cares about shone through from the start. Hinges perfectly engineered so the body of the laptop doesn’t lift as you open the screen, the sleek aluminium finish, the innovative touch bar and especially the incredible speakers all scream premium; the laptop was a pure pleasure to work on. The next massive difference I had noticed from any previous laptop was the battery life. The laptop would run all day without me having to even think about a charger, meaning a total shift in the way I’d use my laptop - no more carrying my charger to work, a small but highly welcomed change. Finally, and for me the most important thing, the development environment available was incredible. Having an underlying unix system meant using tools that were a pain on windows (docker, c/c++, ruby some examples from my experience), just worked. And worked almost instantly. As a Computer Science graduate, I honestly reckon I’d have found my degree easier with the Macbook, and that’s no exaggeration. It’s honestly the most valuable part of the device…
### It’s pricey
Although all the above paints a beautiful picture, and I really have just blown a load of smoke up Tim Cooks *ss. I’m drawn back to thinking about who the Mac users at University really were. Affluent kids that predominantly used Word, Powerpoint and of course scrolling through Facebook. It was a fashion item. This is evident when you consider I completed and submitted a full written assessment on Microsoft Word for Android on a Samsung Galaxy S6. I heavily leveraged the split screen functionality for Chrome and Word to be open at once. Of course a laptop would be far easier if your assessment is anything more than 1-2 pages, but it makes you wonder if spending £2000 or more for a laptop is really worth the menial tasks you’re likely to do on it - doesn’t a chromebook fit the description for standard users? If I wasn’t a developer, the Macbook would score a solid 4/10. An incredible device, but hugely over engineered and priced for a standard user. However, for specialised purposes, be it media editing, software development or anything else that is genuinely easier or only possible on a Mac, it’s a no brainer. A £2000 Mac is a better investment than a £2000 Windows laptop from my experience.

## The iPhone
The Mac was under my belt, but I remember telling my friends and family that I wasn’t becoming an Apple fan boy. I just love one of the products. Loads… Then I purchased my mother a Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and was hugely excited to give her the gift. Once opened the chassis was damaged and the phone wouldn’t charge, Samsung's customer service was dismal and the whole experience pushed me away from ever purchasing anything Samsung ever again (and I had worked for Samsung for two years previously). Suffice I went home that day after a heated discussion with the manager of the Samsung store and ordered an iPhone, literally that day - yeah I really stuck it to Samsung.
### The phone that changed phones forever
Although I never previously wanted an iPhone, I had huge respect for the device; it had changed modern phones into what they are today. 
Instantly, I was underwhelmed, and when I was compiling a list of what I liked about the phone, I was struggling. FaceID is nice, but a bit of a pain during a pandemic when using a mask. The integration with the macbook is nice, but nothing to shout home about. The real game changers for me however was the “Shake to undo” when typing feature - pure brilliance - and also the one handed mode is just very neat, it works perfectly. Of course the other reason you buy an iPhone is the security, which although I’ve not noticed, it’s something I genuinely appreciate about the device over Android Phones.
### Jheeze, it’s overrated
Imagine a polar opposite of my Macbook experience. I felt like I’d gone from a phone with fantastic features, to a bit of a basic phone when migrating to the iPhone. Little things that I had grown to expect from a phone disappeared. Customisable homescreens, widgets on homescreens and when someone rings you, the WHOLE screen is taken up. Really Apple? Then a security hole… why is it people are able to access my widgets (one of them moves money between my bank accounts) without unlocking the phone? Ludacris. Then I thought having a physical switch so I can toggle silent on/off would be brilliant. But it turns out that you can only set it to two presets - you’re not able to switch between Loud/Vibrate/Full Silent without having to venture into the settings app, hugely frustrating. The notifications really trigger me also, responding to them from the notification draw is cumbersome and not efficient and not a great experience as it is on Android. Similarly, when you pull down the notification draw, it takes the whole screen - why? This and the two notification classifications - which helps me miss notifications - earns notification on iPhones the worst feature award. Then a little trip down memory lane… features I was genuinely shocked that iPhones don’t have. Millions of people living in the dark ages not having the ability to Split Screen applications, or float applications on screen. That coupled with the inability for Chrome or Netflix videos to float on screen when you go onto another app really emphasised that these phones aren’t aimed to be hugely functional. They’re £1000+ phones that aren’t meant to be powerful and cutting edge. They’re built to be a simple computer that can be used to communicate with friends, and to take nice photos on. But honestly, I feel budget Android phones provide a more rounded device than this top spec iPhone. The struggle of having to cross my thumb to the left hand side of the screen (Android allows both sides for back - duh) really mirrors the struggle of me wanting to get back to an Android phone ASAP.

## Watch this space
Space Grey Apple Watch Series 5. Before getting this my friend asked my advice for getting an Apple watch. I pitifully laughed at them and told them to buy a Casio (not hating on Casios). Smart watches are just unnecessary, I’d know, I’ve had a few. However, a few months later I found out my Health Insurance runs an offer where if you’re ‘active’ enough, you can get the watch for free. That’s when I though f*** it. I’m 2 deep, let’s complete this Apple trifecta and see what the hype is about
### About time apple
Wow. Fantastic device. I’m not sure how or why it’s so good. I can’t put my finger on it. But the quality of the Apple watch exceeds expectations all around. The applications available are vast, and the optimisations those apps have make it an incredibly well refined experience. The screen and the hugely over engineered waterproofing technology - where it literally blasts the water out of the chassis - is incredible. Then the cherry on the cake is the payment system. It works a breeze, and they’ve recently added a feature to enable quick payments on public transport networks like TfL.
### One big problem
The price… is not actually the problem. When comparing this device to other wearables, I don’t see anything wrong with the price. The only problem is you unfortunately need an iPhone to operate this device. It’s the only problem I see with an otherwise incredible piece of technology.


## An Apple a day keeps the Dentist away
Currently, I use all three devices as my daily drivers. The macbook is and will be the best investment in technology I’ve made. Not only has it pushed me to explore using new technologies in my industry of work (software developer). It’s a pleasure to use generally. However, I would emphasise that most users probably do not need this and a chromebook will likely be perfect for your use case - I’ve used them and they’re fantastic.
The iPhone... I am awaiting Android flagships to slowly trickle out and be announced so I’m able to migrate back. Apple took the phone market share, and I believe that most Apple users are fundamentally bought into the idea that they can’t live without an iPhone. I wish people could migrate to Android for 3 months and understand what life is like when you use a phone with fantastic functionality and more customizability.
Finally, and unfortunately, the Watch will have to disappear along with the iPhone. I’d love to keep it. But it’s useability diminishes with the removal of the iPhone. Here’s to hoping that Android based companies push out an incredible wearable - but I think the problem here lies with Androids wearOS and Google’s lack of quality investment in the platform.
